📚 Educational Content NFTs
📝 Project Description
Educational Content NFTs is a blockchain-based platform that tokenizes learning materials as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

✨ With this innovative solution:

Educators and creators can mint their educational resources as unique digital assets.

They receive ongoing royalties from secondary sales.

Students gain verifiable ownership of their learning materials, with the ability to trade or resell content.

A secure and transparent educational marketplace is created.

The smart contract enables:

🔗 NFT Minting of content.

💸 Automatic royalty distribution to creators.

🔐 Secure ownership transfer.

📝 Metadata storage (title, creator information, content hash, price, and royalty percentage).
