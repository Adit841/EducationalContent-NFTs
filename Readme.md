# Educational Content NFTs

## Project Description

Educational Content NFTs is a blockchain-based platform that tokenizes learning materials as Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This innovative solution enables educators and content creators to mint their educational resources as unique digital assets, while ensuring they receive ongoing royalties from secondary sales. Students gain verifiable ownership of their learning materials and can trade or resell content they've purchased, creating a dynamic educational marketplace.

The smart contract handles the minting of educational content NFTs, automatic royalty distribution to creators, and secure ownership transfer mechanisms. Each NFT contains metadata including the content title, creator information, content hash for verification, pricing, and royalty percentages.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the educational content industry by:

- **Empowering Educators**: Providing creators with a direct monetization channel and ongoing revenue through royalties
- **Enhancing Student Ownership**: Giving learners true ownership of their educational materials with the ability to trade or resell
- **Creating Transparency**: Establishing verifiable proof of content authenticity and ownership through blockchain technology
- **Building Community**: Fostering a decentralized educational ecosystem where quality content is rewarded and accessible
- **Ensuring Sustainability**: Creating sustainable income streams for educators while making education more accessible and affordable
